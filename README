This utility class obtains the country code from an IP4 address. It is based on
the database maintained at: http://software77.net/geo-ip/

The class automatically downloads and updates the database for you. It contains
features to ensure that you don't accidentally break the download limits
that are in place at that site. 

See javadoc for class com.leafdigital.iptocountry.IpToCountry for more
information.


Using binaries
--------------

If you just want to use this class, grab the binary jar files. 

There are two files: iptocountry.[version].jar and 
iptocountry.[version].javadoc.jar.

* You only need the main jar file (add it to your application) to use this
  utility.
  
* The second jar file contains the javadoc documentation. If you add this
  in the 'attached javadoc' field for the library in an IDE such as Eclipse,
  your IDE will be able to automatically show the documentation for this class.
